## Tutorial: Drilling Press Model
[Please Try the following]



It models a simple drilling process. The model consists of three modules for creating, drilling, and disposing parts. The arrival process is random and following the exponential probability distribution with the arrival rate of 0.2 parts per minute.

 

The drilling process has one drilling machine as the only available resouce. The drilling time is also random and following the triangular probability distribution with the minimum time of 1 min, the maximum time of 6 min, and the most likely drilling time of 3 min.

 

The model runs for 20 minutes and the following system performance indicators are reported:

·       The total number of parts entered the system

·       The total number of drilled parts exited the system

·       The maximum number of parts in the system

·       The average number of parts in the drilling queue

·       The average waiting time of the parts in the system

·       The maximum total time of parts recorded in the system

·       The instantaneous utilization of the drilling machine.
